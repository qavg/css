# CSS REVIEW

### Element's Tag Type: Selects all elements of that tag type

`div`, `p`, `ul`, etc

### ID Selector: Select elements with an ID

`#id`

### Descendant Selector: Select an element inside another element

`A B`: Selects all B inside of A. B is called a descendant because it is inside of another element

### Combine the Descendant & ID Selectors:

`#id A`: Selects all A inside of #id

### Class Selector:

`.classname`: Select elements by their class
