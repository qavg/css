# CSS REVIEW

### Element's Tag Type: Selects all elements of that tag type

`div`, `p`, `ul`, etc

### ID Selector: Select elements with an ID

`#id`

### Descendant Selector: Select an element inside another element

`A B`: Selects all B inside of A. B is called a descendant because it is inside of another element

### Combine the Descendant & ID Selectors:

`#id A`: Selects all A inside of #id

### Class Selector: Select elements by their class

`.classname`: `.neato` selects all elements with `class="neato"`

### Combine the Class Selector: You can combine the class selector with other selectors, like the type selector.

`A.className`:
`ul.important` selects all `ul` elements that have `class="important"`
`#big.wide` selects all elements with `id="big"` that also have `class="wide"`
